use cases
	App UI
	Move Customization
		the user that customizes moves wants to
			Before Move
				put conditions that must be satisfied before any other iteration
			Algebra
				put the relative coordinates of the target cell of the moves relative to the piece's position
			Move Generator
				put whether to repeat the pattern to other direction: if the move is not diagonal, repeat this to East, West and South, for North is the default; if the move is diagonal, repeat this to SE, SW and NW, for NE is the default
			Scanner
				put whether to summon a scanner that would scan the relative surrounding tiles of the piece relative to its move's iteration
				put what details of the cell must be true as it gets scanned by the scanner
			After Move
				put which pieces will move into where after that all conditions passed
				put whether the piece will land after the move, which is at default same as where the piece is denoted to move to
				put which details must be added to the relative pieces, when the conditions for a move passed
			Legal Moves
				put which details must be true after that the move is done
			Iteration
				put for each iteration of an iterative move its iterative condition that may: use a scanner to check surrounding details; or define for each iteration its unique condition
